// This is the one part of the importer that is genuinely hard, and it is
// delegated. A polygon offsetter has to cope with the offset self-intersecting
// (an inside offset of a narrow slot collapses and must vanish, not fold back
// on itself), with holes growing while their container shrinks, and with joins
// at reflex corners. Getting any of those subtly wrong cuts a part to the wrong
// size, which is the worst failure this application can have — so it runs on
// Clipper, which has been the reference implementation of exactly this since
// 2010, rather than on something written here.
//
// Clipper works in integers. Coordinates are scaled to micrometres, which is
// two orders of magnitude finer than the machine can position and keeps a
// 1500mm bed at 1.5 million — nowhere near the precision limit.

/**
 * Cut direction.
 *
 * Climb milling means each tooth enters the material at full chip thickness and
 * leaves at zero, which on a router is the better finish and the lower
 * deflection. Deriving the travel direction from that, once, because it is easy
 * to get backwards:
 *
 * A right-hand cutter turns clockwise seen from above. Feeding in +X, the tooth
 * on the tool's left side is moving +X with the feed, and the tooth on the right
 * is moving against it. Same direction as the feed is climb — so climb means the
 * material being cut is on the tool's LEFT.
 *
 * Material is on the left of an anticlockwise loop, since a positively wound
 * ring keeps its interior to the left. So: climb ⇒ travel anticlockwise around
 * whatever the material is inside of.
 *
 * That last clause is the part Clipper's winding alone cannot answer. Clipper
 * marks containment — outers anticlockwise, holes clockwise — not which side of
 * the path the part is. Cutting OUTSIDE a profile keeps the material inside the
 * loop, so the two coincide. Cutting INSIDE one is an aperture: the material
 * kept is outside the loop, and every direction inverts. Taking the winding as
 * the answer would climb-mill every outside cut correctly and conventional-mill
 * every inside one while claiming otherwise.
 *
 * 'on' has no side, so it is left exactly as drawn.
