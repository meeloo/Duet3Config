;
; true  — M581.1 expression triggers (RRF 3.7 and later). The firmware watches
;         the expression and fires trigger2.g when it becomes true.
; false — the polling loop in daemon.g, which is what RRF 3.6 and earlier need.
;
; Left as a switch rather than detected, because getting it wrong in the
; direction of "assume 3.7" on a board that has been rolled back would leave
; the shoe not tracking at all, with nothing on screen saying so. Flip it by
; hand if you go back to 3.6.
